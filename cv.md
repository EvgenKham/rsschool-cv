### :technologist: About Me:

Currently I am looking for a way to convert from a medical worker to a developer, as there is a corresponding education, a huge desire to create a working product, see the result of my work, and develop in front-end direction. There is experience in performing student, laboratory works, as well as pet projects with a code on GitHub. I would like to try my hand at commercial development and contribute to the development of your, and hopefully my, company in the future.
